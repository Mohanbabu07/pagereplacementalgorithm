## About the Project

Page replacement algorithms are crucial in the field of computer memory management, particularly in the context of virtual memory systems. These algorithms decide which memory pages to swap out, replace, or retain in memory. This simulation provides an interactive way to understand and compare these algorithms.

## Supported Algorithms

The simulation includes, but may not be limited to, the following algorithms:

- First-In, First-Out (FIFO)
- Least Recently Used (LRU)
- Optimal Page Replacement
